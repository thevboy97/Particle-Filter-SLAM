# Particle-Filter-SLAM
Implementation of Particle Filter SLAM for an autonomous car in Python using odometry, 2-D LiDAR scans and stereo camera measurements from the car during its motion. Exercised the Particle Filter with a differential-drive motion model and scan-grid correlation observation model for simultaneous localization of the car and occupancy-grid map generation over time.

 
To execute:

Run the code.py file for SLAM which imports from pr2_utils.
Run dead_reckon for the dead reckoning trajectory.
